# Web-API-User-Management

This project contains a simple example of a Web API for user management. The project supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` HTTP methods following REST standards. It also pays attention to HTTP status codes, error handling, model validation, routing, and model binding processes.

## Usage

1. Clone the source code of the project to your computer.
2. Navigate to the project directory and start the project by entering the `dotnet run` command in the terminal/command prompt.
3. You can use an API client (Swagger, Postman, cURL, etc.) to test the API.
